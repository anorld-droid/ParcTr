Problem: Difficulty in Tracking Parcels

The problem that the Android application aims to solve is the challenge of tracking parcels efficiently. Traditional parcel tracking methods often involve manual processes, limited communication channels, and fragmented information, leading to a lack of visibility and delays in parcel tracking. Customers frequently face difficulties in obtaining accurate and real-time updates on the status and location of their parcels. This lack of transparency can cause frustration, uncertainty, and potential inconveniences such as missed deliveries or delayed planning.

The Android application addresses this problem by providing a streamlined and user-friendly solution for tracking parcels. It seeks to improve the overall customer experience by offering a convenient and centralized platform that enables users to easily track their parcels in real-time. By leveraging modern technologies such as GPS, scanning technologies, and robust communication networks, the application aims to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the parcel's whereabouts, transit status, and estimated delivery times.

The application's purpose is to simplify the parcel tracking process, enhance transparency, and provide customers with a reliable tool to stay informed about the progress of their shipments. It aims to alleviate the frustrations associated with parcel tracking, ensuring that users have a convenient and efficient way to monitor and manage their parcels from the moment of dispatch to final delivery.
